Q. 1) Write a PHP script to keep track of number of times the web page has been accessed (Use Session 
Tracking).
Ans:
<?php
Session_start();
If(isset($_SESSION[‘pcount])) {
 $_SESSION[‘pcount] += 1;
} else {
 $_SESSION[‘pcount] = 1;
}
Echo “You have visited this page “.$_SESSION[‘pcount].” Time(s).”;
?>
