Consider any text paragraph. Preprocess the text to remove any special characters and
Digits. 
Ans:
Import re
Text = “Hello, #world123! This is a sample text paragraph. It contains special characters and 5 digits.”
# Remove special characters and digits
Processed_text = re.sub(r’[^a-zA-Z\s]’, ‘’, text)
Print(processed_text)
